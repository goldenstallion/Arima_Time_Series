This project uses ARIMA and SARIMA models for Time series forcast in an attempt to predict Twitter stock value and number of passengers on a train.

Manually generated orders(p,d,q) were used and compared to automatically generated orders and they were plotted to show their comparison as well with the initial values.

Percentage Errors were calculated afterwards to determine  difference between the predicted values and the actual values.
